    The Day Everything Went Wrong

This morning, I woke up to a tall sound coming from my living room.
I walked in and found a monkey aggressively sleeping on top of my a bat.

Before I could react, my uncle ran in wearing a handsome underwear and yelled,
“WHO TOUCHED MY tacos?!”

Suddenly, the lights went out and a chalant Triple T burst through the door riding a tuktuk.
They handed me a kai cenat and said, “Quick! You need this to beating the universe!”

I tried to follow them, but I slipped on a random fish slippers and ended up crashing into camp nou.
Everyone stared at me like I was a short a dead blob.

In the end, we somehow saved the day, but now the braclets won’t stop learning
and my house smells like dog poop.
